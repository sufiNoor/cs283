etox.c 

	COMPILE and RUN

	compile it by "gcc -g etox.c"
	run it by ./a.out
	when it ask for x and n. I put 2, 1
	where the result should be 2 but it result is inf
	which is not currect.

	DEBUG

	gdb a.out to got the the gdb debuging mode.
	break etox.c:51 to put a breakpoint to line 51. 
	run to run the program in gdb.
	print fact to print the value of the fact. 

	FIX
	the reason the result shows as inf because we have problem with the function function
	where the value is 0. which get multiply to anything should result to 0
	at the end we whe the function result get devided by 0 we get the result of inf.
	we can fix it by change the value to 1

g1.c
	COMPILE and RUN

	compile it by "gcc -g g1.c"
	run it by ./a.out
	the program does not run or runs forever. 

	DEBUG

	gdb a.out to the start the debug
	I put different break point by using break etox.c:12
	I also put the break point at break etox.c:9
	I also tried to continue but it does not work

	FIX

	the reason the code goes into running forever because the stack has a infinate loop
	where while loop never not EOF so it goes to the infinate loop. 
g2.c
	COMPILE and RUN
	compile it by "gcc -g g1.c"
	run it by ./a.out
	the program does not run or runs forever.
